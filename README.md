#### Batch Compute Shadows

The Batch Shadow Compute plugin is a spiritual successor to an old script I made _way back_ that automatically calculated shadows for every map in a folder.
That first version technically worked... but despite my best efforts, it wasn't very intuitive and it required a full game restart for every run, and it also had zero awareness of what Trackmania was actually doing, so it couldn't properly warn you if a map, as an example, failed to open.

This plugin aims to fixes some of these issues!

Built entirely as an Openplanet plugin, it works inside Trackmania's editor, adds some better error handling, automatic folder detection, UI-aware navigation, better stability, and generally just feels like the tool I always wanted the original script to be <3

Hopefully you find some use with it!
